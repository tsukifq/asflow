VMUL.VV - Vector-Vector Multiplication
Description:
VMUL.VV performs element-wise multiplication of two vector registers (vs2 and vs1) and writes the results to a destination vector register (vd). This instruction is part of the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV).

Syntax:
vmul.vv vd, vs2, vs1 [, vm]

Operation:
for i = 0 to vl-1:
  if vm[i] == 1 or vm omitted:
    vd[i] = vs2[i] * vs1[i]
  else:
    vd[i] unchanged

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
Illegal instruction exception (if the vector extension is not implemented)

Instruction format:
31-26  25  24-20  19-15  14-12  11-7   6-0
100101  vm   vs2    vs1    000    vd   1010111

Encoding details:
vd = destination vector register
vs2 = source vector register 2
vs1 = source vector register 1
vm = vector mask (v0.t when vm=0, unmasked when vm=1)
opcode = 1010111 (VECTOR)
funct3 = 000 (OPIVV)
funct6 = 100101 (VMUL)

Instruction type:
Vector arithmetic instruction
