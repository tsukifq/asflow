VADD.VI - Vector-Immediate Addition
Description:
VADD.VI performs element-wise addition of a vector register (vs2) and a 5-bit signed immediate value and writes the results to a destination vector register (vd). This instruction is part of the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV).

Syntax:
vadd.vi vd, vs2, imm [, vm]

Operation:
for i = 0 to vl-1:
  if vm[i] == 1 or vm omitted:
    vd[i] = vs2[i] + imm
  else:
    vd[i] unchanged

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
Illegal instruction exception (if the vector extension is not implemented)

Instruction format:
31-26  25  24-20  19-15  14-12  11-7   6-0
000000  vm   vs2    imm    011    vd   1010111

Encoding details:
vd = destination vector register
vs2 = source vector register
imm = 5-bit signed immediate value (-16 to 15)
vm = vector mask (v0.t when vm=0, unmasked when vm=1)
opcode = 1010111 (VECTOR)
funct3 = 011 (OPIVI)
funct6 = 000000 (VADD)

Instruction type:
Vector arithmetic instruction
