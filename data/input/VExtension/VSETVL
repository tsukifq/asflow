VSETVL - Set Vector Length
Description:
VSETVL configures the vector unit by setting the vector length based on register values and updates the vl and vtype CSRs. Unlike VSETVLI, it reads the vtype configuration from a register rather than an immediate. This instruction is part of the RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV).

Syntax:
vsetvl rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
vtype = rs2
vl = minimum(rs1, VLMAX(vtype))
rd = vl

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
Illegal instruction exception (if the vector extension is not implemented or the configuration is invalid)

Instruction format:
31-25  24-20  19-15  14-12  11-7   6-0
1000000  rs2    rs1   1 1 1   rd   1010111

Encoding details:
rs1 = source register containing the requested vector length (or x0 to use the maximum possible vector length)

rs2 = source register containing the vtype value

rd = destination register for the new vector length (or x0 to not write the result)

rs2 encodes vtype settings:

vsew[2:0]: Element width (SEW = 8Ã—2^vsew bits)
vlmul[2:0]: Vector register group multiplier
vma: Vector mask agnostic
vta: Vector tail agnostic
opcode = 1010111 (VECTOR)
