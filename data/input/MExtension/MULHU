MULHU - Multiply High Unsigned

Description:
MULHU multiplies the values in registers rs1 and rs2 and writes the upper XLEN bits of the product to register rd.
This instruction treats rs1 and rs2 as unsigned values and is part of the RISC-V M Extension (Integer Multiplication and Division).

Syntax:
mulhu rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
rd = (rs1 * rs2)[2*XLEN-1:XLEN]

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (MULHU does not cause exceptions)
