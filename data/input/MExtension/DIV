DIV - Divide

Description:
DIV performs signed integer division, dividing the value in register rs1 by the value in register rs2 and writes the quotient to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V M Extension (Integer Multiplication and Division).

Syntax:
div rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
rd = rs1 / rs2 (signed division)

Special cases:
- If rs2 = 0, the result is -1 (all bits set)
- If rs1 = -2^(XLEN-1) and rs2 = -1, the result is -2^(XLEN-1) (overflow)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (DIV does not cause exceptions, even for division by zero)
