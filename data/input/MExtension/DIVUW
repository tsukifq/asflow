DIVUW - Divide Unsigned Word

Description:
DIVUW performs unsigned 32-bit integer division, dividing the value in the lower 32 bits of register rs1 by the value in the lower 32 bits of register rs2, sign-extends the 32-bit quotient to XLEN bits, and writes the result to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V M Extension (Integer Multiplication and Division) and is only available in RV64.

Syntax:
divuw rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
rd = sext((rs1[31:0] / rs2[31:0])[31:0]) (unsigned division)

Special cases:
- If rs2 = 0, the result is 2^32-1 (all bits set in the 32-bit result, then sign-extended)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (DIVUW does not cause exceptions, even for division by zero)

Instruction format:
