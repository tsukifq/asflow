DIVU - Divide Unsigned

Description:
DIVU performs unsigned integer division, dividing the value in register rs1 by the value in register rs2 and writes the quotient to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V M Extension (Integer Multiplication and Division).

Syntax:
divu rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
rd = rs1 / rs2 (unsigned division)

Special cases:
- If rs2 = 0, the result is 2^XLEN-1 (all bits set)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (DIVU does not cause exceptions, even for division by zero)

Instruction format:
