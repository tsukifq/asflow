MULHSU - Multiply High Signed-Unsigned

Description:
MULHSU multiplies the values in registers rs1 and rs2 and writes the upper XLEN bits of the product to register rd.
This instruction treats rs1 as a signed value and rs2 as an unsigned value. It is part of the RISC-V M Extension (Integer Multiplication and Division).

Syntax:
mulhsu rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
rd = (rs1 * rs2)[2*XLEN-1:XLEN]

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (MULHSU does not cause exceptions)
