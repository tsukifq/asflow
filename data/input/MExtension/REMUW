REMUW - Remainder Unsigned Word

Description:
REMUW computes the remainder of unsigned 32-bit integer division, taking the value in the lower 32 bits of register rs1 modulo the value in the lower 32 bits of register rs2, sign-extends the 32-bit remainder to XLEN bits, and writes the result to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V M Extension (Integer Multiplication and Division) and is only available in RV64.

Syntax:
remuw rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
rd = sext((rs1[31:0] % rs2[31:0])[31:0]) (unsigned remainder)

Special cases:
- If rs2 = 0, the result is rs1[31:0] sign-extended to XLEN bits (the dividend)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (REMUW does not cause exceptions, even for division by zero)
