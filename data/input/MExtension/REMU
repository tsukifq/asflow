REMU - Remainder Unsigned

Description:
REMU computes the remainder of unsigned integer division, taking the value in register rs1 modulo the value in register rs2 and writes the result to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V M Extension (Integer Multiplication and Division).

Syntax:
remu rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
rd = rs1 % rs2 (unsigned remainder)

Special cases:
- If rs2 = 0, the result is rs1 (the dividend)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (REMU does not cause exceptions, even for division by zero)
