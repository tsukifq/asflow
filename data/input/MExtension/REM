REM - Remainder

Description:
REM computes the remainder of signed integer division, taking the value in register rs1 modulo the value in register rs2 and writes the result to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V M Extension (Integer Multiplication and Division).

Syntax:
rem rd, rs1, rs2

Operation:
rd = rs1 % rs2 (signed remainder)

Special cases:
- If rs2 = 0, the result is rs1 (the dividend)
- If rs1 = -2^(XLEN-1) and rs2 = -1, the result is 0 (no remainder in this overflow case)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (REM does not cause exceptions, even for division by zero)
