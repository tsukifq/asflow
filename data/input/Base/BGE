BGE - Branch if Greater or Equal

Description:
BGE compares values in registers rs1 and rs2 and takes the branch if rs1 is greater than or equal to rs2, treating the values as signed integers.
The 12-bit B-immediate is sign-extended and multiplied by 2 to form the branch offset, which is added to the pc.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V Base ISA (RV32I/RV64I).

Syntax:
bge rs1, rs2, offset

Operation:
if (rs1 â‰¥ rs2) (signed comparison)
    pc = pc + sext(offset)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (BGE does not cause exceptions)

Instruction format:

XXXXXXX     XXXXX  XXXXX  101   XXXXX      1100011

Encoding details:
imm[12|10:5|4:1|11] = 12-bit signed immediate offset (in multiples of 2 bytes)
funct3 = 101
opcode = 1100011 (BRANCH)

instruction type:
Base
