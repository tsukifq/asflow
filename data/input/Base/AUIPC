AUIPC - Add Upper Immediate to PC

Description:
AUIPC (Add Upper Immediate to PC) forms a 32-bit offset by placing the 20-bit U-immediate value in the top 20 bits and filling the lowest 12 bits with zeros, adds this offset to the pc, and writes the result to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V Base ISA (RV32I/RV64I).

Syntax:
auipc rd, imm

Operation:
rd = pc + (imm << 12)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (AUIPC does not cause exceptions)

Instruction format:
31-12        11-7   6-0
imm[31:12]    rd    opcode
XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXXX 0010111

Encoding details:
imm[31:12] = 20-bit immediate value
opcode = 0010111 (AUIPC)
