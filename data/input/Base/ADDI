ADDI - Add Immediate

Description:
ADDI adds the sign-extended 12-bit immediate to the value in register rs1 and writes the result to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V Base ISA (RV32I/RV64I).

Syntax:
addi rd, rs1, imm

Operation:
rd = rs1 + sext(imm)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
None (ADDI does not cause exceptions)

Instruction format:
31-20     19-15  14-12  11-7   6-0
imm[11:0]  rs1   funct3  rd    opcode
XXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXX  000   XXXXX 0010011

Encoding details:
imm[11:0] = 12-bit signed immediate value
funct3 = 000
