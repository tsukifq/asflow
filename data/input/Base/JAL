JAL - Jump and Link

Description:
JAL (Jump and Link) adds the sign-extended 20-bit immediate (multiplied by 2) to the pc and writes the address of the instruction following the jump (pc+4) to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V Base ISA (RV32I/RV64I).

Syntax:
jal rd, offset

Operation:
rd = pc + 4
pc = pc + sext(offset)

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
Instruction address misaligned exception (if target address is not aligned to instruction boundary)

Instruction format:
31-12                             11-7   6-0

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX             XXXXX  1101111

Encoding details:
imm[20|10:1|11|19:12] = 20-bit signed immediate offset (in multiples of 2 bytes)
opcode = 1101111 (JAL)

instruction type:
