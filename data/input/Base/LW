LW - Load Word

Description:
LW loads a 32-bit value from memory at address in register rs1 plus the sign-extended 12-bit immediate and writes it to register rd.
This instruction is part of the RISC-V Base ISA (RV32I/RV64I).

Syntax:
lw rd, offset(rs1)

Operation:
rd = M[rs1 + sext(offset)][31:0]

Execution privilege:
Machine mode, Supervisor mode, User mode

Exceptions:
Load address misaligned exception (if address not 4-byte aligned)
Load access fault exception (if address invalid or access not permitted)

Instruction format:
31-20     19-15  14-12  11-7   6-0
imm[11:0]  rs1   funct3  rd    opcode
XXXXXXXXXXXX  XXXXX  010   XXXXX 0000011

Encoding details:
imm[11:0] = 12-bit signed immediate offset
funct3 = 010 (width encoding - word)
opcode = 0000011 (LOAD)

instruction type:
Base
