The NOP instruction does not change any architecturally visible state, except for advancing the pc and
incrementing any applicable performance counters. NOP is encoded as ADDI x0, x0, 0.

Here is the extracted TableGen code for the `NOP` instruction:

```tablegen
// ------ RISCVInstrInfo.td ------ //
def : InstAlias<"nop", (ADDI X0, X0, 0)>;
```

The `NOP` instruction is defined as an alias for `ADDI x0, x0, 0`, which is a no-operation instruction in RISC-V. The `InstAlias` directive maps the `nop` mnemonic to the `ADDI` instruction with `x0` as both the source and destination registers and an immediate value of `0`.

This is the complete definition of the `NOP` instruction in the LLVM RISC-V TableGen code. It does not have any inherent classes or inheritance hierarchy since it is simply an alias for the `ADDI` instruction.
